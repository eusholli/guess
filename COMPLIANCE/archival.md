# Data Archival Checklist

## Prerequisite

It is important to fully understand the principles of "Privacy by Design" to best complete this checklist. Please visit [Data Protocol](https://dataprotocol.com) for prerequisite training courses.

## Introduction

The collected data value may experience many rounds of usage and publication, but eventually the end of its life begins to loom large. The first part of this is to archive the data. Data Archival is the copying of data to an environment where it is stored in case it is needed again in an active production environment, and the removal of this data from all active production environments.

A data archive is simply a place where data is stored, but where no maintenance, usage, or publication occurs. If necessary the data can be restored to an environment where one or more of these occur.
