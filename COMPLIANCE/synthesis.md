# Data Synthesis Checklist

## Prerequisite

It is important to fully understand the principles of "Privacy by Design" to best complete this checklist. Please visit [Data Protocol](https://dataprotocol.com) for prerequisite training courses.

## Introduction

This is comparatively new, and perhaps still not a very common phase in the Data Life Cycle. It can be defined as the creation of data values via inductive logic, using other data as input.

It is the arena of analytics that uses modeling, such as is found in risk modeling, actuarial modeling, and modeling for investment decisions. Derivation by deductive logic is not part of this – that occurs in Data Maintenance. An example of deductive logic is Net Sales = Gross Sales – Taxes. If I know Gross Sales and Taxes, and I know the simple equation just outlined, then I can calculate Net Sales.

Inductive logic requires some kind of expert experience, judgement, and/or opinion as a part of the logic, e.g. the way in which credit scores are created.
