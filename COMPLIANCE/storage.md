# Data Storage Checklist

## Prerequisite

It is important to fully understand the principles of "Privacy by Design" to best complete this checklist. Please visit [Data Protocol](https://dataprotocol.com) for prerequisite training courses.

## Introduction

Once data has been created within the organisation, it needs to be stored and protected, with the appropriate level of security applied. A robust backup and recovery process should also be implemented to ensure retention of data during the lifecycle.

However with privacy considerations it is also very important to understand what data should be stored and for what minimum length of time.

In general

- You must not keep personal data for longer than you need it.
- You need to think about – and be able to justify – how long you keep personal data. This will depend on your purposes for holding the data.
- You need a policy setting standard retention periods wherever possible, to comply with documentation requirements.
- You should also periodically review the data you hold, and erase or anonymise it when you no longer need it.
- You must carefully consider any challenges to your retention of data. Individuals have a right to erasure if you no longer need the data.
- You can keep personal data for longer if you are only keeping it for public interest archiving, scientific or historical research, or statistical purposes.

Also it must be ensured that appropriate security measures are in place to protect for both data in motion and data at rest.

- Measures must ensure the ‘confidentiality, integrity and availability’ of your systems and services and the personal data you process within them.
- Measures must also enable you to restore access and availability to personal data in a timely manner in the event of a physical or technical incident.
- It also needs to ensure that you have appropriate processes in place to test the effectiveness of your measures, and undertake any required improvements.

Security is a large issue and more details can be found [here](https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-data-protection/guide-to-the-general-data-protection-regulation-gdpr/security/)
