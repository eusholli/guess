# Data Protocol Lean Compliance

Data compliance is a priority for all code being written that uses personal identifying data that could infringe on privacy. Data Protocol is the world's leading commmunity focusing on the needs of the developer community with respect to data management and privacy. Lean Compliance &copy; integrates the lean approach into how developers already work with git, version control and lean development processes.

The templates assume knowledge of Privacy by Design and asssociated required best practices.

To learn this please visit [Data Protocol](https://dataprotocol.com) and take the associated online courses.

The simple process to follow is as follows

1. List all "jobs to be done" that require data from the user to complete

1. For each "job to be done", complete an associated description using [jtd_template.md](./jtd_template.md) as a base

1. Use [jtd_checklist.md](./jtd_checklist.md) to ensure the maximum amount of proactivity and application of "[Privacy by Design](https://dataprotocol.com)" and associated best practices.
