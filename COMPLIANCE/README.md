# Data Protocol Lean Compliance

## Introduction

Data compliance is a priority for all code being written that uses personal identifying data that could infringe on privacy. Data Protocol is the world's leading commmunity focusing on the needs of the developer community with respect to data management and privacy. Lean Compliance &copy; integrates the lean approach into how developers already work with git, version control and lean development processes.

The templates assume knowledge of Privacy by Design and asssociated required best practices.

To learn this please visit [Data Protocol](https://dataprotocol.com) and take the associated online courses.

The simple process to follow is as follows

1. List all reasons for collecting data.

1. Use the checklists contained in the [status template](./status.md) to consider whether all best practice guidance has been considered and applied.

1. Complete the [status template](./status.md) of privacy by design application, and checkin the latest alongside the versioned code.

### New Projects

For new projects, consider these aspects before starting coding and ensure they are updated as the code evolves.

### Existing Projects

For existing projects, consider what data is already being used and stored, understand the reason why and complete the table (using the checklists) reactively. As the code and data usage further evolves, document and consider proactively.
