# Data Erasure Checklist

## Prerequisite

It is important to fully understand the principles of "Privacy by Design" to best complete this checklist. Please visit [Data Protocol](https://dataprotocol.com) for prerequisite training courses.

## Introduction

We now come to the actual end of life of the data. Data erasure is the removal of every copy of a data item from all locations.

Ideally, this will be done from an archive. A Data Governance challenge in this phase of the data life cycle is proving that the purge has actually been done properly.
