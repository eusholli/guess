# Data Publication Checklist

## Prerequisite

It is important to fully understand the principles of "Privacy by Design" to best complete this checklist. Please visit [Data Protocol](https://dataprotocol.com) for prerequisite training courses.

## Introduction

It is possible that our this data may be sent to an external entity. This is Data Publication, which can be defined as the sending of data to a location outside beyond your control and ownership.

An example would be a brokerage that sends monthly statements to its clients. Once data has been sent externally it is de facto impossible to recall it. Data values that are wrong cannot be corrected as they are beyond reach.
